# My First React Native App

This is my first attempt at learning React Native. 

## Why I built it

It only displays text and buttons on the screen along with some images and backgrounds.
The purpose of this app was to learn "Stack Navigation" and I have set it up so that 
the button on the first page navigates to the second page, which was the goal of the exercise.

## Next steps

An app that is actually useful and has a function besides learning out "stack navigation" works.
